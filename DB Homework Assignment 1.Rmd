## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Question 1: Create a new vector in R with the data for each strain.
```{r}
transgenic.strain.A = c(0.17,0.20,0.13,0.20,0.24,0.25,0.15,0.21,0.21)
transgenic.strain.B = c(0.47,0.21,0.34,0.32,0.33,0.29,0.18,0.20,0.25)
common.strain = c(0.44,0.33,0.37,0.33,0.31,0.27,0.22,0.30,0.28)
```


##Question 2: What is the difference between the means of the two transgenic streams?

```{r}
mean(transgenic.strain.A)-
mean(transgenic.strain.B)
```
#The difference between the two means of trangenic strains is 0.09222222


##Question 3: What is the difference between the means of the common strain and transgenic strain A
```{r}
mean(common.strain)-
mean(transgenic.strain.A)
```
#The difference between the means of the common strain and transgenic strain A are 0.1211111


##Question 4: Create a histogram of the hydrogen peroxide concentrations in the common strain
```{r}
potato.H2O2=read.csv(choose.files())
```
```{r}
hist(potato.H2O2$Common.Strain, main = "H2O2 Concentrations in Common Strain Potato Plant Leaf Tissues", xlab="H2O2 Concentration (umoles/g)", ylab="Observed Frequency")
```


##Question 5: Enter each column as a vector in R, and collect these into a single data frame. Name the hydrogen peroxide column as 'Peroxide' and fungal growth rate column 'Growth.rate'.
```{r}
Peroxide=c(0.27,0.21,0.34,0.32,0.24,0.29,0.18,0.20,0.29)
Growth.rate=c(1.79,1.01,1.71,1.89,1.41,1.15,1.13,1.20,1.10)
Sample.number=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
```
#Collecting the vectors into a data frame

```{r}
Fungus=data.frame(Peroxide,Growth.rate)
Fungus
```


##Question 6: Create a scatter plot of fungal growth rate versus peroxide concentration from the newly created data frame. Make sure to label the plot properly (label the axes and make sure to provide the measurement units).
```{r}
plot(Fungus$Peroxide,Fungus$Growth.rate, xlab='Hydrogen Peroxide concentration (umoles/g)', ylab= 'Growth Rate (cm/day)', main='Potato Leaf Fungal Resistance')
```


##Question 7:How does the growth rate of the fungus change with increasing levels of hydrogen peroxide, and does this agree or disagree with the hypothesis?
```{r}
mean(Peroxide)
mean(Growth.rate)
```
```{r}

my.reg=lm(Fungus$Growth.rate~Fungus$Peroxide)
summary(my.reg)
plot(Fungus$Peroxide,Fungus$Growth.rate, xlab='Hydrogen Peroxide concentration (umoles/g)', ylab= 'Growth Rate (cm/day)', main='Potato Leaf Fungal Resistance')
abline(my.reg)
abline(h=1.376667, col='light blue')
abline(v=0.26, col='red')

```
#Based on the general trend of the data and the location of the averages in line with where a line of best fit would be place, the null hypothesis would be rejected as with greater levels of hydrogen peroxide there is greater growth rates of the fungus trending towards significance p<0.067.


##Question 8: Re-create this table in Excel and save as a comma separated values file. Read the data into R using the read.csv function.
```{r}
turtle.nesting=read.csv(file.choose())
```
```{r}
turtle.nesting
```


##Question 9: Use the table function to create a contingency table showing the number of aborted and successful nesting attempts for each species.
```{r}
my.table=table(turtle.nesting$Nesting.status,turtle.nesting$Species)
my.table
```


##Question 10: Make and label a grouped barplot that represents the nesting patterns for all three turtle species. Colour the bars for successful green and the bars for aborted red. Make sure to label the axes.
```{r}
barplot(my.table,main="Comparison of Turtle species by Nesting Status", xlab='Turtle Species', ylab= 'Observed Nest Frequency', col = c('red','green'), beside=TRUE)
```


##Question 11:Determine the mean and standard deviation of successful nesting events among all marine turtles.
```{r}
nest.survival=c(my.table[2,1],my.table[2,2],my.table[2,3])
nest.survival
mean(nest.survival)
sd(nest.survival)
```
#The mean and standard deviation of successful nesting amongst all turtle species are 8 and 6.9, respectively.


##Question 12: Calculate the proportion of failed nesting attempts for each species. Based on this, which species would you choose as needing the greatest conservation effort?
```{r}
hawksbill.aborted=my.table[1,1]/ (my.table[1,1]+my.table[2,1])
hawksbill.aborted
leatherback.aborted=my.table[1,2]/ (my.table[1,2]+my.table[2,2])
leatherback.aborted
oliveridley.aborted=my.table[1,3]/ (my.table[1,3]+my.table[2,3])
oliveridley.aborted
```
#Based on this the Hawksbill species need the greatest conservaton effort as 43% of their nests are failed attempts.


##Question 13: Enter data into Excel and import the file to R.
```{r}
hatchery.survival=read.csv(choose.files())
hatchery.survival
```


##Question 14:Create a boxplot comparing different turtle species and the number of eggs found in the nest. Don't forget to label your axes.
```{r}
boxplot(hatchery.survival$Olive.Ridley, hatchery.survival$Hawksbill, hatchery.survival$Leatherback, names=c("Olive Ridley", "Hawksbill", "Leatherback"), main= "Turtle eggs laid by species", ylab='Eggs Laid', xlab='Turtle Species', col=c('red', 'light blue','green'))
```


##Question 15: Create a scatter plot of the number of Leatherback turtle eggs (y-axis) against the number of Hawksbill turtle eggs (x-axis) across all beach sections
```{r}
plot(hatchery.survival$Hawksbill, hatchery.survival$Leatherback, main='Comparing Turtle Eggs Laid', xlab='Hawksbill Turtles', ylab='Leatherback Turtles', xlim = c(100,150), ylim=c(85,150))
```
